# Entry Level Grinders
If you’re reading this, welcome to espresso! This rabbithole can be as deep or shallow as you want it, but it’s always nice to make educated choices about the equipment you’ve chosen. If you’ve been on the subreddit seeing the endless equipment questions, you’ve probably seen the following phrase - “The grinder is just as important as the machine”. I’ll just go ahead and confirm right now, this is true. The grinder is more important than the machine once you hit a certain basic capability of machine (Around the unpressurized Bambino / Gaggia Classic mark).

### Marketing
You’ll find cheaper grinders advertising they can grind for espresso; they can’t. There is a distinction to be made between pressurized and unpressurized espresso, as in an unpressurized basket there is no grinder under $100 new that will grind fine or consistently enough to provide adequate resistance to flow. Pressurized baskets are also referred to as “dual wall” baskets.

### Adjustment
In order to change extraction and flow rate in espresso, it is required to make grind size changes. The finer you grind, the slower the shot (most of the time). Small changes in grind can have a drastic effect on extraction time, in the range of 5-10 seconds on, say a Baratza Encore. Capable espresso grinders have “microsteps” or “stepless grind adjustment” in order to allow for minute adjustment.

### Grind Quality
In these price ranges, you’re not going to get a perfectly even grind. However, in this case I am referring to grind consistency in being able to produce the same grind distribution multiple times in a row. Cheaper grinders will sometimes make great shots, and if you keep the same setting it will suddenly clog or run very fast. Consistency is being able to make the same shot, for multiple days in a row.

### How to work with stepped grinders
If you bought an Encore with the intention of using it for espresso, you can still make things work. It won’t be easy or pretty, but you can make it work while you either shop for another grinder, save up, or maybe just decide it’s not for you (pourover is amazing). Encores (and the Virtuoso) do not come calibrated to grind fine enough for espresso from the factory, so you can calibrate the grinder to grind finer. Once you do that, if you find yourself in between two steps, you can grind until the machine is clogged, and then you can reduce the dose by 0.5g steps until the shot flows. It’s not ideal, but it’s doable.
